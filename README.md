## FAQ

**Q:** Can I use CleanWin safely?  
**A:** No, you have to understand what the functions do and what will be the implications for you if you run them. **If you're not sure what the script does, do not attempt to run it!**

**Q:** I've used CleanWin and it did something I don't like, how can I undo it?  
**A:** For every tweak, there is also a corresponding function which restores the default settings. The default is considered freshly installed Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016 with no adjustments made during or after the installation. Use the tweaks to create and run new preset. Alternatively, since some functions are just automation for actions which can be done using GUI, find appropriate control and modify it manually.

**Q:** I've run CleanWin and it broke my computer / killed someone / caused an apocalypse.  
**A:** I don't care, and that's not a question.

**Q:** I'm using a tweak for &lt;feature&gt; on my installation, can you add it?  
**A:** Submit a PR, create a feature request issue or drop me a message.
